Intro to Github
 - Github is a web based distributed version control system.
 - A version control system manages files as they are changed over time.
   - Each time you commit a change the difference between the original and the 
     current state is saved
   - This allows every previous version of a file to be recreated without storing 
     the entire file for each revision
   - This only works for text files.  Binary files like images, pdfs and word docs 
     require the storage of the entire file for each revision.
 - A distributed version control system is a version control system where every 
   revision of every file is stored on each computer with a copy of the repository
   - This increases the total size of the repository on each computer
   - Their are many reasons to pay that cost
     - Faster and easier for an individual to look at history
     - Can work with full version control while disconnected from the server
     - Connection is only required to share changes with others
     - Individuals can pull from each other without going through the server
 - Version control systems are scary until you realize that one major purpose is to 
   reduce the repercussions of mistakes
 - Large Binary files are generally not good because as noted above each modification
   requires another copy of the file.
   - Generally small binary files are OK but even a 200KB file can quickly eat a lot of space
   - I put a few large pdfs in the Doc repository because I intend to never edit them.  It was 
     still sloppy.
   - Large files can be put on a USB drive or on something like drop box
